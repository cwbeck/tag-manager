In this area you can manage your **Application Revisions**.

When a revision is ready it must be **finalised** to be linked to an environment
and used on the application.

To make further changes it then necessary to clone it to a new revision.

To allow to test the changes within the Revision 
it is always possible to **preview** a revision,
even when it is not finalised.
