Use this form to add an **Action Group Distribution** 
(creating custom or linking a global one).

In an Action Group Distribution of type **None**
the actions within will be executed normally.

In an Action Group Distribution of type **Session** or **Page Load**
is possible to create Action Groups that will be executed with
a certain probability.

With type **Page Load** the distribution is determined on each page load,
while using type **Session** will lock the distribution until the session
expires.
 
It is possible to specify a **comment** to be associated with the operation in
the entity **history** when creating a custom Action Group Distribution.
