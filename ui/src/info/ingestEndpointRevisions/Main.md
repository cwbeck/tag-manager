In this area you can manage your **Ingest Endpoint Revisions**.

When a revision is ready it must be **finalised** to be linked to an environment
and used on the application.

To make further changes it then necessary to clone it to a new revision.

To allow to test the changes within the Revision  it is  possible
to **preview** the **payload** format and types.
